# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## This repo holds two products

Read this before touching anything at the root — the layout is not obvious.

| Path | Product | Deployed to |
|---|---|---|
| `server/` | Dakyworld OS, the internal ops app (API + React client) | Railway → **os.dakyworld.com** |
| repo root (`index.html`, `about.html`, … `assets/`) | the public marketing website, static HTML | GitHub Pages → **dakyworld.com** |
| `website-drafts/` | superseded homepage explorations | served but unlinked |

The website sits *at the root, beside `server/`* because GitHub Pages can only
serve from the root or `/docs` on this repo, and changing that needs a
dashboard setting. It is not a mistake — don't "tidy" it into a subfolder
without also changing the Pages source, or the live site 404s.

`CNAME` contains `dakyworld.com`. It claimed `os.dakyworld.com` for months
while that subdomain actually pointed at Railway, so Pages served nothing and
the apex returned 404 with a bad certificate. If the apex ever breaks again,
check `CNAME` against DNS before anything else.

Railway's Root Directory is set to `server`, so **`server/railway.json` is the
file that applies**; the root `railway.json` is a fallback for a configuration
that isn't active. Keep them in step.

## Commands

```bash
# Server (from server/)
npm run dev              # tsx watch, http://localhost:4000
npm run build            # builds server/client first, then the API
npm run build:server     # prisma generate + tsc only
npm run seed             # sample client/lead/project/invoice
npm run prisma:migrate   # see the migration gotcha below
npx tsc --noEmit         # typecheck

# Client (from server/client/)
npm run dev              # vite, http://localhost:5173
npm run build            # tsc -b && vite build
```

**There are no tests and no linter in this repo.** `npx tsc --noEmit` in both
`server/` and `server/client/` plus a real build is the whole verification
story — do not claim a change is "tested" on the strength of a passing build.
For anything visual or document-shaped, render it and look (below).

Local setup, the Docker Postgres line, and `DEV_NO_AUTH` are covered in
[README.md](README.md#running-it-locally) — follow it rather than improvising.

## Architecture

**Server** — Express, one router per domain under `src/routes/`, mounted in
`src/index.ts`. The mounting order matters: the unsubscribe route is public and
registered *before* `attachUser`/`requireAuth`, and `/api/imports` is excluded
from the JSON body parser because it takes uploads. `src/lib/` holds
integration clients (Apify, Anthropic, Google, Stripe, Cloudinary, mailer) and
`src/services/` holds the logic that composes them.

**Client** — Vite + React + React Router + TanStack Query, in `server/client/`.
The server serves the built client from `client/dist` when it exists, and falls
back to an API-only status page when it doesn't.

**Database** — Prisma, 30 models. `prisma/schema.prisma` is the source of truth.

**Integration keys live encrypted in the database**, not in env vars — the
`AppSetting` model, keyed by `APP_SECRET`. That is deliberate: adding or
rotating a key must never need a redeploy. Env vars still override where they
exist. **Rotating `APP_SECRET` makes every stored key unreadable.**

**Auth** — `src/middleware/auth.ts`. `DEV_NO_AUTH=true` runs the API as one
implicit Owner and is force-disabled when `NODE_ENV=production`. `requireRole()`
gates the routes that spend money (scrapers, imports) or write to clients.

## The brand design system is canonical

`DAKYWORLD-BRAND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (69 numbered sections, held by the owner)
governs every surface: the website, the OS admin UI, and every generated
document. Reuse existing components and tokens before inventing anything.

```
Ink #08101F   Navy #0B0A16   Blue #3157FF   Blue-light #6490FF
Cyan #6FE4FF  Lime #B8FF3D   Cream #F4F5F0  Muted #69758A  Line #DFE4EB
Space Grotesk (display) · DM Sans (body)
```

Three rules that are repeatedly got wrong:

1. **Lime is action and positive status only** — roughly 1–5% of a surface. It
   is a mark colour and never type on white. On light surfaces the accent is
   blue. Generators that touch both light and dark carry two accent constants
   for exactly this reason.
2. **Blue is structure, selection and emphasis.** When something needs an
   accent and isn't an action, it is blue.
3. **A gold/bronze/ivory identity was retired in Aug 2026.** If you find
   `#C7A24C`, `#8A6A2F`, `#F7F4EE`, `#0B0B0C`, `#6E6A63`, Playfair Display or
   Inter, it is a leftover, not a choice. `website-drafts/` still contains
   them, deliberately, as history.

Token values live in three places that must agree: `assets/site.css` (website),
`server/client/tailwind.config.js` (OS UI), and
`server/src/services/letterhead.ts` (documents, which re-exports to `pdf.ts`).
Near-miss values (`#F5F7F2`, `#68738A`, `#DFE4EC`, `#0B1630`) were swept out in
Aug 2026 — reintroducing one is new drift.

Real logo artwork exists as of Aug 2026 in `assets/brand/`, in an `-on-light`
and an `-on-dark` cut. The wordmark has its own typeface — **never re-set it in
Space Grotesk**. `server/assets/logo.png` and `mark.png` are picked up
automatically by the letterhead at render time; the typographic fallbacks in
`letterhead.ts` and `proposalDocx.ts` exist for when the files are absent and
should stay.

## Render it and look at it

Reviewing document and layout code by reading it does not work here — a
half-page lime dash, a letterhead stamped over a cover page and a mis-set
first-page flag all passed code review and were obvious on sight.

```bash
# HTML → PNG
"C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" --headless=new \
  --disable-gpu --window-size=1440,900 --virtual-time-budget=10000 \
  --screenshot=out.png "file:///absolute/path.html"

# PDF → PNG (PyMuPDF; poppler/ImageMagick are not installed)
python -c "import fitz; fitz.open('a.pdf')[0].get_pixmap(dpi=110).save('p1.png')"
```

- Chrome needs a `file:///` URL or an HTTP server; a bare path fails DNS, and
  ES-module pages (the React client) need real HTTP.
- Scroll-reveal CSS hides below-fold content — render a temp copy with the
  reveal styles overridden. Scrolling a fixed-header page in headless Chrome
  tends to produce a blank capture; render tall instead.
- Chrome cannot screenshot a PDF — it renders a blank grey page.
- `.docx` → PDF goes through Word COM; a successful open also doubles as a
  corruption check after bulk XML edits.

**Neither brand font is installed on this machine.** Word and local renders
substitute, so headings come out serif. The files are still correct — do not
"fix" a document that only looks wrong here.

## Gotchas that cost real time

- **`prisma generate` fails with `EPERM … query_engine-windows.dll.node`**
  whenever a node process still has the Prisma client loaded — a dev server
  left running from an earlier session counts. Find it with
  `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='node.exe'"`, stop it, retry.
- **Postgres enum values cannot be added and used in one migration**
  (`55P04 unsafe use of new value`) — the addition needs its own earlier
  migration. `prisma migrate dev` is hostile to non-interactive use here; build
  the SQL with `prisma migrate diff --script` into a hand-made folder, then
  `migrate deploy`.
- **Docker Desktop is usually not running.** Launch it and poll for the daemon
  before any `docker run`.
- **Railway's Root Directory and GitHub-repo connections are dashboard-only** —
  the CLI has no subcommand for them. Report the click path instead of retrying.
- Tailwind's config maps `blue`, `lime` and `cyan` to single brand values, which
  replaces those default scales. `blue-500` and friends do not exist; the red,
  amber and emerald scales are untouched and carry error/warning/success states.

## Committing

Push and deploy without asking — the owner has given standing approval for
finished work. Railway auto-deploys `server/` and GitHub Pages auto-publishes
the root on every push to `main`.
